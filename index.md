# About

I am a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), advised by [Tyler Sorensen](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/) since Spring 2021. 

My research interests are heterogeneous computing, programming languages, and compiler techniques. In particular, I am working on HW/SW co-design for sparse applications, such as accelerating sparse tree applications on heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, I am interested in compiler techniques that automate this process, and I am also looking forward to developing novel programming models for sparse data structures.  


## Posters

### REDwood: Heterogenous Implementation of Tree Applications with Accelerated REDuctions
[[Extended Abstract]](img/redwood/PACT_2022.pdf) [[Poster]](img/redwood/PACT2022SRC.pdf) 

> We identify a class of applications, which we call traverse-REDuction applications, that have a flexible heterogeneous decomposition. We proposed a framework that provides a high-level interface to efficiently implement a wide range of traverse-REDuction algorithms. 

* Presented at International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT 2022) as Student Research Competition

## Research Experiences (Undergrad)

### Interactive Generative 3D Shapes
[[Paper]](img/3d-shapes/paper_final.pdf) [[Slides]](img/3d-shapes/presentation.pdf) [[Code]](https://github.com/xuyanwen2012/interactive_generative_3d_shapes)


> Implemented a shrink-wrap algorithm from SIGGRAPH that can normalize similarly shaped 3D meshes for machine learning applications. We leveraged the power of an Autoencoder to explore the latent space behind the 3D shapes in the same category.

### Pedestrian Simulation for Autonomous Vehicles Testing

> Researched behavior tree approaches and social force models in Unreal Engine to procedurally generate testing scenarios and dynamically spawning navigation meshes for autonomous vehicle testing. Actively developing Unreal Plugins for [Augmented Design Lab](https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/adl) at UCSC.

### 3D Interactive Dungeon Generation using SMT Solver

> Defined dungeon generation problems as linear constraint problems. We proposed a practical pipeline for level designers to generate dungeon layouts efficiently.

### Denoising Multipath Interference in Time-of-Flight Imaging
[[Paper]](img/3d-tof/Denoising_3D_Time_Of_Flight_Data.pdf) [[Code]](https://github.com/daemonslayer/3d-tof-denoising)


> We propose a novel method for MPI noise removal using a two-part convolutional neural network. We demonstrate and validate our results on a synthetic dataset.
